    "For my project, I've selected a synthetic dataset known as \"Fraudulent E-Commerce Transactions.\" This dataset was created to simulate typical online shopping transactions, with a specific focus on detecting fraudulent activities. It comprises an extensive set of 1,472,952 transactions and has 16 features that capture a wide range of information relevant to both genuine and fraudulent transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my analysis, I'm particularly interested in the 'Transaction ID' and 'Customer ID,' which uniquely identify each transaction and customer, respectively. The 'Transaction Amount' and 'Transaction Date' provide financial and temporal details of each purchase. Payment methods include options like credit cards and PayPal, and the 'Product Category' gives insights into what was bought. The 'Quantity' field shows the number of items per transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer demographics are captured in fields like 'Customer Age' and 'Customer Location,' which help in profiling typical purchasing patterns. The type of device used, along with the IP address from which the transaction was created, offers additional layers of data for analysing access patterns and potential security breaches. Shipping and billing addresses might highlight discrepancies used to flag frauds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the dataset includes an 'Is Fraudulent' label, marking each transaction as fraudulent or legitimate, which is crucial for my goal of training machine learning models to detect fraud. The 'Account Age Days' and 'Transaction Hour' provide further context, revealing how newly created accounts might behave and at what times transactions occur, which can be indicative of fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is entirely synthetic, generated through Python's Faker library and tailored algorithms to reflect realistic transaction patterns, including fraudulent scenarios. It's intended solely for educational and research purposes, providing a safe and ethical way to study fraud detection without compromising real personal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I dive into this dataset, my objective is to use some of these detailed features to build robust models that can not only detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy but also offer insights into the dynamics of e-commerce fraud. This work could then be used as a benchmark for developing and testing future fraud detection systems in a controlled, scalable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will aim to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we identify characteristics of customers who are more likely to be involved in fraudulent transactions?\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the key features that contribute to the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we build an accurate machine learning model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not?"

    "## 1.2 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "I found my data in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/fraudulent-e-commerce-transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The notebook submitted is already run as it is time-consuming to run again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a 393 MB dataset was strategic and aimed at demonstrating the methodology's effectiveness before scaling up. I tried previous larger datasets for fraud; however, it seemed to be very time-consuming with it taking typically 6 to 8 hours to run. Even though it still took a couple of hours to run, this size proved sufficient to validate the functionality of data processing pipelines while being manageable within the computational resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my analysis, I will use Apache Spark and its MLlib library, both of which are staples in the industry for handling large datasets in a distributed computing environment. Spark can scale horizontally, allowing for the same analytical processes to be applied to larger datasets without significant alterations to the code.  Moreover, MLlib provides robust machine-learning algorithms that can be tuned and optimised for a variety of tasks, including binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the predictive model developed in this coursework could be useful in an e-commerce platform's fraud detection system. By predicting fraudulent transactions accurately, this model can help in flagging and handling suspicious activities. This will help mitigate any potential losses. Additionally, the insights gained from the model’s predictions could inform strategic decisions regarding resource allocation, customer service, and security measures. \n",
    "For my project proposal, I will start with data pre-processing to ensure that the data is ready for effective EDA and modelling. Following this, I will apply various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosted Trees, to train and evaluate. The best model will then be tuned using techniques such as random search to optimise their performance. It is important to consider that in a real-world scenario, the patterns of fraudulent transactions may evolve as the e-commerce environment is always changing. Therefore, these models need to be regularly updated with the new data to remain accurate and relevant. Spark allows for real-time fraud detection as the developed model can be saved and distributed across the e-commerce platform."

    "Generally, the variables look okay. Given the range from 1 to 365, the data shows how \"old\" most accounts are, which helps in identifying any patterns related to the account age and fraudulent activities. Furthermore, the Transaction Hour reveals patterns about when transactions typically occur, e.g.,a high number of transactions occurring at unusual hours. However, there seems to be an anomaly of a negative age with a minimum of -16. Also, the transaction amount seems to have a high standard deviation. Therefore, visualising this later in the EDA will be helpful to understand the skewness or presence of outliers in transaction values. Visualising the rest of the variables will also be helpful to better understand the data. Since age cannot be negative I will handle this first."

    "I made a heatmap to see how different things like the amount spent and customer age are linked. The heatmap used colors to show blue for less connection and red for more. To my surprise, most of the factors I considered weren't strongly linked to each other. The figures, which indicate the strength of a link, were really close to zero for the majority. However, I noticed an interesting pattern where 'Is Fraudulent' and 'Transaction Amount' had a correlation of about 0.27, suggesting that the transaction amount could potentially be a flag for fraud. Even more, 'Account Age Days' and 'Transaction Hour' showed negative correlations with fraud, with 'Account Age Days' presenting a notably stronger negative link. This could imply that newer accounts or transactions during certain hours may be more susceptible to fraudulent activities. These few, yet significant, hints amongst the other weaker correlations tell me that customer behavior is complex and can't be guessed just by looking at simple links between things like age and how much they spend. So now, instead of expecting clear patterns, I will try out some more complex analysis methods to really understand what's going on in the data. "

    "The data is highly imbalanced with a significant skew towards non-fraudulent transactions. This class imbalance is common in fraud detection scenarios because fraudulent activities are generally rare compared to legitimate transactions. Therefore,when training the machine learning model on this data, it's crucial for me to handle this imbalance appropriately to ensure the model doesn't become biased towards predicting non-fraudulent transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Technqiues, such as oversampling the minority class and undersampling the majority class is necessary.\n",
    "Evaluation Metrics: Given the imbalance, accuracy might not be a reliable metric alone for evaluating the model performance. Metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, or the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) are more indicative of how well the model is performing, especially in detecting the minority class (fraudulent transactions)."

Resampling strategies help in balancing this bias, making models more sensitive to the minority class, which improves the models and is crucial in fraud detection[2].

The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) was approximately 0.505, indicating that the model performs similarly to random guessing, which suggests that Naive Bayes might not be well-suited for this dataset due to its underlying assumptions, such as feature independence, not holding true. The precision of the model was relatively high at about 77.87%, meaning that when the model predicted a transaction as fraudulent, it was correct approximately 77.87% of the time. However, the recall was only around 66.82%, indicating that the model missed about a third of actual fraudulent transactions. The F1 Score, which balances precision and recall, was 53.89%, reflecting the model's moderate effectiveness in managing the trade-off between missing frauds and incorrectly flagging legitimate transactions. This evaluation led me to consider exploring more complex models improve detection accuracy."

    "The Logistic Regression model has shown a significant improvement with an Area Under the ROC (AUC) of approximately 0.767, compared to the Naive Bayes model. It demonstrates the ability to discriminate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The model also showed a precision of approximately 0.752, indicating that a significant proportion of the identified fraudulent transactions were truly fraudulent. Furthermore, it achieved a recall of about 0.757, which implies that it successfully identified approximately 75.7% of all actual fraudulent transactions in the dataset. Additionally, the F1 Score, balancing precision and recall, was approximately 0.737. This shows a good model performance considering both false positives and false negatives. This improvement suggests that Logistic Regression is a better fit for the data. I assume this is likely due to its capability to handle correlated features and more complex relationships between variables."

    "I applied a Decision Tree model to the data to see the patterns and classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate based on their features. After training the model on a segmented dataset, I tested its ability to predict fraud in unseen data, achieving an Area Under the ROC of approximately 0.439. This metric indicates the model's capability to differentiate between the classes and the low score suggests that it needs to be improved. Additionally, I assessed the model's precision, recall, and F1 score, which stood at 0.782, 0.787, and 0.779, respectively. These metrics provided a deeper insight into the model’s performance, confirming a reasonable balance between sensitivity and specificity. I visualised some of the model's predictions to verify the probability distributions and classification outcomes. The Decision Tree's structure, detailed down to 21 nodes, enabled a granular look at how various thresholds and features drive the model's decisions, revealing the complexity and the specific conditions under which transactions are classified as fraudulent. This detailed analysis helped in understanding the model's decision-making process and offered a clear view of how features such as transaction hour, amount, and others influence predictions."

    "I developed models to analyse the data by incorporating various features such as 'Transaction Hour', 'Quantity' of items purchased, and a distinctive column labeled 'Unusual Combo'. This classification tags transactions as \"Normal\" or \"Unusual\" based on the combination of 'Transaction Hour' and 'Quantity'. Specifically, I defined 'Unusual' transactions as those occurring outside of regular business hours (before 6 AM or after 8 PM) and involving a quantity of four or more items. I leveraged this tailored feature and employed a Gradient Boosted Tree model, which after thorough cross-validation, showed an excellent Area under ROC of 0.8188855713473334. The model's precision was quite high at 0.7839314725945281, with a recall of 0.7888316903428391, and an F1 Score of 0.7805108036059984. This indicates that there is a balanced performance between precision and recall. The predictions from the model, illustrated in a sample output, reflect the probability of transactions being fraudulent, providing clear insights and enhancing decision-making capabilities in identifying unusual transactional activities."

    "In my development of predictive models for identifying fraudulent transactions, I employed various features such as 'Transaction Hour' and 'Quantity' of items purchased, as well as a derived feature named 'Unusual Combo.' This categorisation was based on transactions that occur outside typical business hours, before 6 AM or after 8 PM It involves quantities that equal or exceed four, defining these as \"Unusual.\" Employing a Gradient Boosted Trees model optimised through cross-validation achieved good performance metrics on the test data set. The model displayed an Area under the ROC of approximately 0.819, reflecting a strong ability to differentiate between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Additionally, the accuracy reached about 78.9%, with a precision of approximately 78.4%, and a recall of 78.9%. This illustrates a balanced sensitivity and specificity. The F1 Score, also stood at 0.781. These results are encouraging as they underscore the efficiancy of the model in flagging potential fraud while minimising false positives and negatives. This is crucial for maintaining trust and operational efficiency in transaction processing systems."

    "This coursework was aimed at using big data analytics to build a predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions within an e-commerce environment. Using the power of distributed computing through Spark and Hadoop, this project aimed to go further than traditional analytical methods to accommodate a thoughtfully chosen dataset size. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "The project focused on analysing a synthetic dataset, \"Fraudulent E-Commerce Transactions\". This had around 1.5 million records and was 393 MB in size. Each record in the dataset was detailed with 16 features, providing a solid foundation for understanding transaction patterns and behaviours associated with fraudulent activities. My main objective was to apply machine learning techniques to detect potentially fraudulent transactions by exploring various features such as the transaction amount, customer demographics, and transaction timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tModel Performance: I used multiple machine learning models, such as Naïve Bayes; Logistic Regression; Decision Trees; Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees. The Gradient Boosted Trees model was the most effective, achieving an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve of 0.818. This model demonstrated a robust capability to discriminate between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFeature Importance: The analysis highlighted significant features that were useful in predicting fraud. For example, 'Transaction Amount' and 'Transaction Hour' were shown to be important predictors of fraud. This is useful in the real world as it offers insights into how different transaction features can influence fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tInsights into Fraud Dynamics: My project illustrated that fraudulent transactions are not randomly distributed but correlate with specific customer behaviours and transaction characteristics. For example, I found that there were high transaction amounts during unusual hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges Encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tData Scalability: While the distributed nature of Spark and Hadoop facilitated the handling of large datasets, I faced challenges related to scalability. The choice of a 393 MB dataset was strategic and aimed to demontrate my methodology's effectiveness before scaling up. Model training and prediction took between 5 minutes to an hour to run, suggesting that the DSM may have had limited resources as many others were also running this. In addition, I faced several challenges in the spark context stating out-of-memory errors. Nevertheless, even though it may have taken a while to run, my choice of dataset size proved sufficient to validate the functionality of data processing pipelines while being manageable within the computational resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tModel Complexity: The complexity of the models and the depth of data required a careful balance between accuracy and performance. My initial models did not perform as expected, which necessitated further tuning and refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tSynthetic Data Limitations: The use of a synthetic dataset, while reducing privacy concerns, posed limitations regarding the generalisability of the model to real-world data. Since it was synthetic, it might not fully capture the nuanced behaviours seen in genuine customer transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings from this project are useful for both academic and practical applications in e-commerce fraud detection. By identifying key predictors of fraud and the effectiveness of various modelling approaches, the project contributes to ongoing efforts to secure e-commerce platforms against fraudulent activities. Furthermore, the exploration of data scalability and model complexity provides valuable insights into the operational challenges associated with big data analytics in fraud detection. This project proposal was made to be able to mimic tasks in the industry as predictive models could be used to predict fraud. Pyspark and MLib can run in a distributed manner and larger datasets of the same data used in the industry can be run with the same code. However, the models should be trained again to improve the predictive accuracy, maybe every few months depending on the application. Overall, the project proposal provides a foundation for more effective and efficient fraud detection strategies for e-commerce.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations for Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tEnhanced Data Collection: Future projects could benefit from using real transaction data to enhance the model's applicability to actual e-commerce scenarios.\n",
    "•\tAdvanced Modelling Techniques: Exploring more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, could potentially improve the detection accuracy by capturing more complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "•\tFeature Engineering: Further development of feature engineering techniques could show more indicators of fraud that were not apparent in my current models. For instance, the use of IP addresses and geographic features could be useful for identifying where fraud is more common. However, this was not done as it increases time and resources."
