For my project, I've selected a synthetic dataset known as "Fraudulent E-Commerce Transactions." This dataset was created to simulate typical online shopping transactions, with a specific focus on detecting fraudulent activities. It comprises an extensive set of 1,472,952 transactions and has 16 features that capture a wide range of information relevant to both genuine and fraudulent transactions.

As I dive into this dataset, my objective is to use some of these detailed features to build robust models that can not only detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy but also offer insights into the dynamics of e-commerce fraud. This work could then be used as a benchmark for developing and testing future fraud detection systems in a controlled, scalable manner.

### I will aim to answer: ###

Can we identify characteristics of customers who are more likely to be involved in fraudulent transactions?
What are the key features that contribute to the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent?
Can we build an accurate machine learning model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not?
